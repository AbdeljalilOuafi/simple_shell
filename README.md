			      Simple Shell Project

**UNIX Command Interpreter (Shell) Project**

This project is a simple UNIX command interpreter implemented in the C programming language. The interpreter provides a command-line interface where users can enter and execute various UNIX commands. It aims to replicate some of the functionality of popular UNIX shells
The goal of this project is to create a command interpreter that produces the same output and error messages as the /bin/sh shell. The only difference should be that when printing an error, the name of the program (argv[0]) should be equivalent to your shell's name.
